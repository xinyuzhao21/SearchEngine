The system supports basic index creation from a collection and retrieval with a simple retrieval
method. The system also provides varies compression options. Structurally, the system is divided
into packages based on the different stages of the abstract Indexing process. According to the
process, we have “fetch the documents”, “tokenize and transform the texts”, and “create the
inverted list”. Thus, the system is naturally divided into the “fetcher”, “tokenizer”, “indexer”
packages which contain multiple classes involved in each stage. To suit the need of this project,
the system also has “IO” package for general file reading and writing, the “compression”
package for V-byte and Delta encoding, and “retriever” and “scorer” for Dice coefficient
calculation and query processing. Within each package, there is also some level of abstraction to
encapsulate the high-level idea achieved through the abstract classes. By using abstract classes
such as Fetcher, Document, Compression, and Tokenizer, the system can also avoid large
refactoring.
The trade-off of this design is that it would require more code to implement and thus more time.
However, I hope that this design would make future modifications and Unit Testing/Debugging
easier. Also, since I am not very familiar with the concepts, those plannings and abstractions
would potentially become unnecessary overheads.
